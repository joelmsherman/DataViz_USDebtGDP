# Makeover Monday (MoM) - Week 47
**US Debt and GDP Over Time**

## MoM Background
Makeover Monday is a weekly learning and development opportunity to work with a given data set and create better, more effective visualizations.  The goal with MoM is to make information more accessible, and participants are from around the world.  MoM is sponsored by Tableau.  Each week, sponsors post a visualization to be improved, along with a dataset for the original visualization.  Participants then make and share their vizs and the community gets smarter and more creative as a whole!

## Source Article and Viz
This week's Viz: Week 47 brings [a viz](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w47-why-americas-debt-doesnt-stop-growing/workspace/project-summary?agentid=makeovermonday&datasetid=2020w47-why-americas-debt-doesnt-stop-growing) showing both total debt and GDP by year over time.  

## Data Source
Data is sourced from FRED (various agencies) [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP)

## My Approach for Week 46
The original visualization was pretty good, but a little busy, and not directly emphasizing public debt as a proportion of GDP, which is how it should typically be visualized.
